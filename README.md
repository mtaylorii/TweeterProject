#What still needs to be done:
- GUI
- Search via #
- Search for users
- Send message to another user with @
- Subscribing
- Viewing different sets of posts (all, public only, subscribed-to only, @ resposes only)
- Deleting an account*
- Add functionality for a database file of twit ID's, Twit messages, posters of the Twit, and photo file path (Cole)

Feel free to add/remove anything as you see fit.
